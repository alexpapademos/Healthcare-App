# PAPADIMOS ALEXANDROS PROJECT 

Development of a Medical Data Collection and Monitoring System (Ανάπτυξη Συστήματος Συλλογής Και Παρακολούθησης Ιατρικών Δεδομένων)
Overview

This project is part of a university exercise focusing on the development of a Medical Data Collection and Monitoring System. The primary goal of this system is to gather, manage, and monitor patients' medical data in real-time, enabling healthcare providers to have easy access to crucial health information.

The system is designed with scalability and efficiency in mind, supporting various types of medical data from multiple sources, and ensuring a secure, user-friendly environment for both patients and healthcare professionals.
Features

    Real-time Data Collection: Collects patient medical data such as vital signs, lab results, and medical history in real-time.
    Data Monitoring: Continuously monitors and updates medical data, alerting healthcare professionals to critical conditions.
    User Management: Secure authentication and role-based access control for patients, doctors, and administrators.
    Data Visualization: Graphical representation of medical data to support decision-making and monitoring of patient conditions.
    Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and integrate with external healthcare systems (e.g., hospitals, clinics).
    Security and Privacy: Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive medical data by following industry best practices in security and privacy (e.g., GDPR compliance).

# HealthProjectApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
